# miccai23-swipe-implicit-segmentation
SwIPE (Segmentation with Implicit Patch Embeddings) is a medical image segmentation approach that utilizes implicit neural representations (INRs) to learn continuous representations rather than discrete representations commonly seen in modern methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers, or combinations of both).
